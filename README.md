TYPO3 extension for generating `llms.txt` links according to the [llmstxt.org specification](https://llmstxt.org/) to control Large Language Model crawling policies.

## Features

- **Automatic llms.txt generation** - Creates policy files according to the official specification
- **Site navigation structure** - Includes your site's navigation hierarchy in the llms.txt file
- **Configurable metadata** - Add topics, contact information, and custom descriptions
- **Markdown export** - Convert any TYPO3 page to Markdown format via `.md` suffix
- **TYPO3 v13 compatibility** - Built specifically for TYPO3 v13 using modern PHP practices

## What is llms.txt?

llms.txt is an emerging standard for websites to communicate with Large Language Models and AI systems. Similar to robots.txt for web crawlers, llms.txt files provide:

- **Crawling policies** - Guidelines for AI systems on how to interact with your content
- **Site structure** - Navigation and content organization information
- **Metadata** - Topics, contact information, and site descriptions
- **Content access** - Direct links to machine-readable content formats

## Installation

### Composer (Recommended)

```bash
composer require web-vision/ai-llms-txt
```

## Quick Start

After installation, the extension works immediately with default settings:

- **llms.txt generation**: Visit `https://yoursite.com/?type=1699`
- **Markdown pages**: Visit `https://yoursite.com/?type=1701`

with Route Enhancer:

- **llms.txt file**: Visit `https://yoursite.com/.well-known/llms.txt`
- **Markdown pages**: Add `.md` to any page URL (e.g., `https://yoursite.com/about.md`)

## Configuration

All settings can be configured in your site configuration.


## Route Configuration

To enable user-friendly URLs, include the route enhancers in your site configuration:

```yaml
# config/sites/main/config.yaml
imports:
  -
    resource: 'EXT:ai_llms_txt/Configuration/Routes/RouterEnhancer.yaml'
```

This enables:
- `.md` suffix for Markdown content
- `llms.txt` for direct access to the specification file

## Usage Examples

### Accessing Generated Content

**llms.txt files:**
- `https://yoursite.com/?type=1699`
- `https://yoursite.com/.well-known/llms.txt` - with route enhancer
- `https://yoursite.com/llms.txt` - Alternative access (with route enhancer)

**Markdown content:**
- `https://yoursite.com/?type=1701`
